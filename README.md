# Laboratory Experiments :

1 -a) Write a LEX program to recognize valid arithmetic expression. Identifiers in the expression could be only
integers and operators could be + and * . Count the identifiers & operators present and print them separately.<br><br>
1 - b) Write YACC program to evaluate arithmetic expression involving operators: +, -, *, and /

2 - Develop, Implement and Execute a program using YACC tool to recognize all strings
ending with b preceded by n a’s using the grammar an b (note: input n value)

3 - Design, develop and implement YACC/C program to construct Predictive / LL(1)
Parsing Table for the grammar rules: A ®aBa , B ®bB | e. Use this table to parse the sentence: abba$

4 - Design, develop and implement YACC/C program to demonstrate Shift Reduce
Parsing technique for the grammar rules: E ®E+T | T, T ®T*F | F, F ®(E) | id and parse the sentence: id + id * id.

5 - Design, develop and implement a C/Java program to generate the machine code using
Triples for the statement A = -B * (C +D) whose intermediate code in three-address form:<br>
T1 = -B<br>
T2 = C + D<br>
T3 = T1 + T2<br>
A = T3<br>

6 - a) Write a LEX program to eliminate comment lines in a C program and copy the resulting program into a separate file.
<br><br>
6 - b) Write YACC program to recognize valid identifier, operators and keywords in the given text (C program) file.

7 - Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to simulate the working of Shortest remaining time and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms. Experiment with different quantum sizes for RR algorithm.

8 - Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to implement Banker’s algorithm. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.

9 - Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to implement page replacement algorithms LRU and FIFO. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.

10 - a). Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to simulate a numerical calculator.

10 - b). Design, develop and implement a C/C++/Java program to simulate page replacement technique.

11 - Program to recognize whether a given sentence is simple or compound.

12 - Write a C++ program to emulate the Unix ln command
